## Context 

A Monte Carlo simulation is used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty.

A Monte Carlo simulation is used to tackle a range of problems in many fields including investing, business, physics, and engineering.

## Build 

Since we only have a simple file to build, we can compile the project using 
```
g++ monte-carlo.cpp
```

If I am implementing other pricing methods, a Cmake would be much cleaner
